## Running components locally (via Storybook)

To launch a demo page with the component and all the pre-defined test cases for a component, we use the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) tool which is a popular tool for JS developer to showcase their work.
This tool is very handy because it is launched locally and do not need to deploy anything anywhere. There is a hot-reloading feature included that help develop locally new features, whenever the code is changed inside a JS/Typescript, the Storybook reloads automatically.

    make package-storybook p=<name-of-component>

For instance, if you want to launch the Storybook of the `react-xyz` component (located in `./packages/react-xyz` directory):

    make package-storybook p=react-xyz

Then a local webserver will be automatically launch and your browser will open directly on the local Storybook web page, you will then be able to test and manipulate your components.
For more information on how to add stories to a Storybook, please refer to Storybook document [here](https://storybook.js.org/) and modify files of the component/package you want to test in the `./packages/<package-name>/__stories__/` directory.
