#### Install AWS Profiles

AWS CLI is using configuration files located in your home directory (as one of its method) to authenticate your api requests when using the tool.
There are 2 important files:

* `~/.aws/credentials`: contains your personal credentials
* `~/.aws/config`: contains additional profiles (so-called roles to assume)

To set your profiles, follow these steps:

* ensure you have a personal IAM user and proper credentials that were provided to you (a so-called `Access Key Id` and `Secret Access Key`). These are your personal API credentials that you must not share with others. If not, please contact the Team Tech Lead.
* ensure you have the following content to your `~/.aws/config` file (or create it with that content):


    [profile xxxxxxxx-dev]
    role_arn=arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
    source_profile=xxxxxxxx

    [profile xxxxxxxx-test]
    role_arn=arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
    source_profile=xxxxxxxx

    [profile xxxxxxxx-preprod]
    role_arn=arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
    source_profile=xxxxxxxx

    [profile xxxxxxxx-prod]
    role_arn=arn:aws:iam::YYYYYYYYYYYY:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
    source_profile=xxxxxxxx


* ensure you have the following content (at least) in your `~/.aws/credentials` file (or create it with that content):


    [xxxxxxxx]
    aws_access_key_id = <your-AKI-here>
    aws_secret_access_key = <your-SAK-here>


##### Acceptance test

    AWS_PROFILE=xxxxxxxx-dev aws s3 ls

... should display a non empty list of s3 buckets for DEV environment.
