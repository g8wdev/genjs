### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

Whereas an IDE is required to work on this project, you can choose whatever professional IDE to work with Javascript you want. Here is a short list of proposed ones:

* Free: [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Commercial: [JetBrains WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/webstorm/)

We do not recommend Text-only Editor (Sublime-Text, TextEdit, vi, vim, emacs, ...) for working on this project.
