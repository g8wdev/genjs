### Terminal/Console

Whereas a Terminal/Console is required to work on this project, you can choose whatever professional Terminal/Console program you want. Here is a short list of proposed ones:

* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) (macOS only)
* [Linux console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_console) (Linux only)

We do not recommend Windows-based Terminal/Console for working on this project.
